name: environmental feature
def: "A material entity which determines an environmental system." [DOI:10.1186/2041-1480-4-43, NM:nm, ORCID:0000-0002-4366-3088]
comment: A material entity determines an environmental system when its removal would cause the collapse of that system. For example, a seamount determines a seamount environment, acting as its 'hub'. This class is currently being aligned to the Basic Formal Ontology. Following this alignment, its definition and the definitions of its subclasses will be revised.

name: environmental system
def: "A system which has the disposition to environ one or more material entities." [DOI:10.1186/2041-1480-4-43]
comment: In ENVO's alignment with the Basic Formal Ontology, this class is being considered as a subclass of a proposed BFO class "system". The relation "environed_by" is also under development. Roughly, a system which includes a material entity (at least partially) within its site and causally influences that entity may be considered to environ it. Following the completion of this alignment, this class' definition and the definitions of its subclasses will be revised.

name: human dwelling
def: "A self-contained constructed feature used by one or more households as a home, such as a house, apartment, mobile home, houseboat or other 'substantial' structure. A dwelling typically includes nearby outbuildings, sheds etc. within the curtilage of the property, excluding any 'open fields beyond'. It has significance in relation to search and seizure, conveyancing of real property, burglary, trespass, and land use planning." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwelling accessed 11/25/2015]

name: tidal mangrove shrubland
alt_id: CMECS:577
def: "A shrubland biome which is densely vegetated by dwarf or short mangroves (and associates) that are generally less than 6 meters in height, is tidally influenced,  is located in tropical or subtropical areas." []
comment: This class aligns to the Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard (CMECS). In ENVO, we may adapt the definition for consistency, but the semantics (meaning) of the term should be unaffected. Please consult the CMECS catalogue (https://cmecscatalog.org/) for authoritative and semantically unconstrained definitions. CMECS provides the following notes: "Commonly found on intertidal mud flats along the shores of estuaries. Tidal mangrove shrublands may include immature stands or stunted mature trees that indicate a harsh growing environment. Areas characterized by tall mangroves (> 6 meters) are placed in the Tidal Mangrove Forest Biotic Group. Where tidal amplitude is relatively low, the vegetation forms narrow bands along the coastal plains, and it rarely penetrates inland more than several kilometers along rivers. Where tidal amplitude is greater, mangroves extend further inland along river courses, forming extensive stands in the major river deltas. Also, mangrove cays may occur within the lagoon complex of barrier reefs. The list of biotic communities for this group is long: a few examples are provided below, and the complete list is available in Appendix F"
