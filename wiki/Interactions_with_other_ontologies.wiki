#summary Overview of other ontologies that provide terms for or may import terms from the PCO.

= Ontologies =

==BFO==

The PCO currently imports BFO1.1 for root nodes in the PCO.

==IAO==
PCO imports IAO's ontology_metadata.owl

==CARO==

PCO imports *organism* and *organism or virus or viroid* from CARO. 

CARO2 will import "population" from PCO.

Logical definition of population will probably refer to "organism or virus or viroid", rather than organism.

We are discussion the definitions of these terms with CARO curators.

==EnvO==
*Biome* and its subclasses are covered by the [http://www.environmentontology.org Environment Ontology] (EnvO). Further discussion is needed for defining the proposed EnvO class _habitat_ as it relates to populations.

==EFO==
The Experimental Factor Ontology has some terms for populations. Need to talk to them about it at some point.
