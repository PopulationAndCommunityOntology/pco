#summary Overview of other ontologies that provide terms for or may import terms from the PCO.

= Ontologies =

==BFO==

The PCO currently imports BFO from the OBO purl and uses this for root nodes in the PCO. May want to switch to BFO1.1

==IAO==
PCO imports IAO's ontology_metadata.owl

==CARO==

PCO will import *organism* and *organism or virus or viroid* from CARO. 

CARO will import "population" from PCO.

Logical definition of population will probably refer to "organism or virus or viroid", rather than organism, so it would not be appropriate to use "organism population as the primary name. Perhaps "biological population"?

We are discussion the definitions of these terms with CARO curators.

==EnvO==
*Biome* and its subclasses are covered by the [http://www.environmentontology.org Environment Ontology] (EnvO).

==EFO==
The Experimental Factor Ontology has some terms for populations. Need to talk to them about it at some point.
