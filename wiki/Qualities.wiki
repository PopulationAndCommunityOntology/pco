#summary Discussion of how to deal with quality terms.

= Qualities of groups of organisms =

PCO will have a number of terms for population qualities (e.g., growth rate, age structure), community qualities (e.g., species richness, number of trophic levels), and qualities of other collecitons of organisms. 

The question is whether these terms should have PCO ids or PATO ids.

= Phenotypic Quality Ontology (PATO) terms =

population quality (PATO:0002003) =def. A quality that inheres in an entire population or part of a population.

_I think saying that it inheres in part of a population is problematic, because it is too broad. A leaf is a part of one tree, which is part of a population. Population qualities should be confined to populations. If there is a need to define qualities of groups of organisms that are parts of populations, we can make classes for those groups, and define qualities specifically for them_

-Has two subclasses: mixed sex (PATO:0001338) and morbidity (PATO:0001415)._

=bahavior quality=

PATO currently has a term for behavioral quality (PATO:0000186), which is confined to organisms. Some of these subclasses may be needed for PCO.

Need to consider if there are behavioral qualities that involve more than one organism.
