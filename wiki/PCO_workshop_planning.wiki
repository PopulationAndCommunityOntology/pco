The Phenotype RCN has some funding available for travel. Considering requesting support for a 2 day workshop to take development of the PCO to the next level. Integration with other ontologies should be a major focus.

Will need input from both domain experts (to provide use cases and definitions) and ontology experts (to advise on how to integrate with BFO and more advanced ontology modeling).
