The PCO currently imports the BFO and uses BFO terms for root nodes (e.g. PCO:population process is a subclass of BFO:process). Other terms will be imported from IAO, CARO, PATO, and GO.

Of particular interest is how to deal with [BiologicalProcesses] and [Qualities] for populations and communities, which may fall within the domain or GO or PATO, respectively.

See the [Interactions_with_other_ontologies] for more details.
