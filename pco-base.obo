def: "Anatomical structure that is an individual member of a clade and, at some point in its life-cycle, consists of more than one cell." []
comment: MH: Can't define this class based on 2 or more cells because most multi cellular organisms (if not all) have only a single cell at some point in life history.
comment: MH: sexual subtypes should probably be logically defined based on sexual processes or sex qualities.

comment: A general term for organism that is agnostic about single cell vs multi-cellular.  Note that this is a subclass of 'anatomical structure', meaning that an organism must be a connected structure.  So, if I take one plant and make a rooted cutting from a it, I now have two (clonally related) organisms.

comment: It is sometimes difficult to define the physical boundaries of a population. In the case of sexually reproducing organisms, the individuals within a population have the potential to reproduce with one another during the course of their lifetimes. 'Community', as often used to describe a group of humans, is a type of population of organisms. \n\nClasses for population already  exist in IDO ('organism population', IDO_0000509) and OBI ('population', OBI_0000181). The definitions should be standardized across OBO Foundry ontologies and only one term used.

comment: Ecological community is defined broadly here, but includes both ecological interactions (inherited from parent term community) and spatial co-existence. It may be used to describe every organisms living in an area, but is often used to refer only to organisms of a particular taxon or guild (e.g., the plant community, the insect community, the herbivore community). The word community, as it often used to describe a group of humans living together, is a type of single-species collection of organisms, not an ecological community.

name: population process
def: "A process that has as primary participant a population. Includes processes such as population growth, extinction, evolution, selection, and adaptation. Population processes may depend on the processes of individual organisms {e.g., population growth reflects the cumulative multicellular organism reproduction (GO:0032504) and death (GO:0016265) of all individuals in a population}, but cannot be described for an individual organism. Some of these processes (e.g., evolution, extinction) can also occur at the species level, so PCO distinguishes between, for example, population extinction and species extinction." []
comment: The GO has the terms 'multi-organism process' (GO:0051704) and 'intraspecies interactions between organisms' (GO:0051703), but these categories are only defined for interactions between two individuals. It is unclear at this point if 'biological process' (GO:0008150) encompasses population processes.

If the taxon is species, then this is the same as the class species as a collection of organisms. When defining a taxon, it is generally understood that members include both living organisms and dead organisms that are known through specimens or observations." []
comment: This term is neutral with respect to which organisms are included in a taxon. Membership will depend on the taxon concept and the assertions used to define the taxon. These criteria must be specified by the user. The best practice is to refer to a formal taxon description, rather than informal names "Genus species" without an authority.

Only a few nomadic people have retained this form of lifestyle in modern times. Also, the temporary movement of people for the purpose of travel, tourism, pilgrimages, or the commute is not regarded as migration, in the absence of an intention to live and settle in the visited places." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration

def: "An ecological community which is composed of co-existing populations of microbial organisms that interact, directly or indirectly, such that they impact one another's ecological fitness." []
comment: The definition of a microbial species is deeply debated, however, units of phylogenetic and functional diversity are recognised with respect to their varying roles in an ecosystem. In turn, there exist multiple operational definitions of microbial community, such as local, phenomenological, and indexical communities. This class seeks to capture microbial communities in a very broad sense, as collections of phylogenetically and functionally divergent microbial organisms co-existing, potentially interacting, and competing for niche space in the same ecosystem over a period of time in which their causal footprints overlap one another.
